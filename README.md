## Reflection

### Major concepts used / exercised
- grid layout
- planning out high-level & low-level structure
- responsive text sizes & grid layout
- practicing various css properties: shadows, overflow, background, min/max sizing, svg editing
- using a self-hosted font
- tested in another browser besides Chrome
- for the sake of time, I forewent making the html semantically correct and adding alt text

### Did well / Room for improvement
This project provided me valuable experience in planning out a complex webpage â€” coding a wireframe in HTML with basic styling, and especially filling in the more low-level details. Pictured is an early draft I created.

The low-level details I learned to pay more attention to included padding & gap size, font sizes, how elements should respond to different font sizes, potential text overflows, grids within grids, and alignments. <strong>To improve on:</strong> While I was able to exercise these, I can still improve in them by paying more attention to where they arise so I can pre-emptively put them in the wireframe and make classes & custom properties to connect any commonalities; it'd help preclude future debugging and refactoring the code to be less spaghetti. 

Total time spent: 28 hours to finish dashboard. 1 hour writing reflection and looking at other people's projects.
